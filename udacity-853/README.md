========

This is a step-by-step (tagged) check-in of the "Sunshine" application developed as part of the Udacity ["How to Develop Android Applications"](https://www.udacity.com/course/ud853) course (UD 853). 

This is the first project that we are tackling in the group, for self-study. We will use this document to provide links and summarize lessons related to the development. The planned learning schedule can be found [here](https://github.com/gdg-hudson-valley/android-garage/blob/master/MeetingPlan.md).
