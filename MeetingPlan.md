GDG Garage: Android & Wear Development
The "Android & Wear" GDG Garage is part study-group, part hacker-club, and all awesome fun! The goal is to get together in person (and occasionally on hangouts) to develop Android applications individually or collaboratively.

Plan

We will start by reviewing the materials in the Udacity "Developing Android Apps" Course according to the following schedule. This is mandatory.

Interested folks are encouraged to also sign up for the Coursera "Programming Mobile Applications.." Course which kicks off its second run on September 26. This is optional but highly encouraged.

After completing the Udacity course, everyone should be in a position to start developing basic Android applications. We will then use the meetings to work on individual/collaborative Android projects to improve our coding and design skill. Ideally, the first half of each meeting will focus on doing a deep-dive into a specific API, concept or application (tear-down) to understand best practices, with the second half of the meeting left open for hacking on our code projects.
