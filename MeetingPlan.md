GDG Garage: Android & Wear Development
======================================

The "Android & Wear" GDG Garage is part study-group, part hacker-club, and all awesome fun! The goal is to get together in person (and occasionally on hangouts) to develop Android applications individually or collaboratively.

Plan
-----
We will start by reviewing the materials in the [Udacity "Developing Android Apps" Course](https://www.udacity.com/course/ud853) according to the following schedule. This is mandatory.

Interested folks are encouraged to also sign up for the [Coursera "Programming Mobile Applications.." Course](https://www.coursera.org/course/android) which kicks off its second run on September 26. This is optional but highly encouraged.

After completing the Udacity course, everyone should be in a position to start developing basic Android applications. We will then use the meetings to work on individual/collaborative Android projects to improve our coding and design skill. Ideally, the first half of each meeting will focus on doing a deep-dive into a specific API, concept or application (tear-down) to understand best practices, with the second half of the meeting left open for hacking on our code projects.

### Learning Schedule

A tentative schedule for beginners where the date indicates what needs to be done BY THAT DATE. 
We can speed up the progress based on comfort level.
